    "In this lab, we will be visualizing and analyzing water networks for specific utilities in CA. First off, we will simply visualize the network associated with you utility (i.e. the sources that lead into it). Then, we will analyze the flow of water in these networks and how they have changed over time. Finally, we will perform energy analysis calculations in order to see in more depth how the flow of water has changed and what effects this has had. At this time you should have been assigned a utility to visualize and analyze. Here is a mapping of utiliy names to their respective codes in the graphs and data.\n",
