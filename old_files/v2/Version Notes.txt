Version: 2.0

Capabilities:

1) Visualize the network using the links data

2) Calculate the energy footprint at each node


Instructions:

1) With the file opened in Atom.io, proceed to open the Julia console.

2) Julia requires that you precompile each line of code for the SWS.jl script
to work.  You can do this in two ways:
   a) "SHIFT ENTER" each line of code that you want to run in order
   b) Run the file

3) SubNetworkSummary will give you the utilities upstream of the utilitiy you pick

4) Visualize the data:
Simple plots:
dot -Tsvg "California network.dot" > "California network.svg"

Complex plots:
dot -Tpdf "California network.dot"  -Kdot  -o "California network.svg"


Changes:

Cleaned up first version to only include functions useful for calculating
and visualizing the network's energy footprint.
